# Open Chat bots
These are bots for OpenChat

There are three types of bots that OpenChat supports: 
- **Command bots**: which accept a command from an OpenChat user from within the OpenChat interface.
- **Integration bots**: which accept a command from an external system using an API key.
- **Autonomous bots:** which generate their own commands and interact with the OpenChat backend autonomously.
